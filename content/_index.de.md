Stateful Functions Documentation
================================

**Stateful Functions** is an open source framework that reduces the complexity of building and orchestrating distributed stateful applications at scale. It brings together the benefits of stream processing with Apache Flink® and Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) to provide a powerful abstraction for the next generation of event-driven architectures.

There are many ways to get started with Stateful Functions. Which one is the best for you depends on your goals and prior experience. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you’ll find this section helpful.

## Learn By Doing

If you prefer to learn by doing, start with our code [walkthrough](/getting-started/python-walkthrough/). It provides a step by step introduction to the API and guides you through real applications.

## Learn Concepts Step By Step

If you prefer to learn concepts step by step, start with our guide to [main concepts](/concepts/). It will walk you through all the API's and concepts to build advanced stateful systems.


## Start A New Project

The [project setup](/getting-started/) instructions show you how to create a project for a new Stateful Functions application in just a few steps.
